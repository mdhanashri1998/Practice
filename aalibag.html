	Located along the coast of the Arabian Sea, the Alibaug Beach is a picturesque stretch of sand situated in Maharashtra. Alibaug is a black-sand beach which offers the panoramic sight of the Kolaba fort from the shores. Amber sand lies underneath its coarser black counterpart, and its unique sight is further accentuated by the rocks that lazily lie around the entire landscape. The ruins of the fort are clearly visible from the Alibaug beach which can be easily accessed by waddling through the waters in low tides and a short boat ride during high tides.
